China (650 million, 48% of population), the penetration of e-commerce is low compared to markets like the United States (266 million, 84%), 
or France (54 M, 81%), but is growing at an unprecedented rate, adding around 6 million new entrants every month.The industry consensus is
that growth is at an inflection point.In India, cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method, accumulating 75% of the e-retail 
activities. Demand for international consumer products (including long-tail items) is growing much faster than in-country supply from 
authorised distributors and e-commerce offerings.Largest e-commerce companies in India are Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon India, Paytm,Zomato and Instamojo.
